This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from a series of digital marketing campaigns conducted over February 2021. The analysis encompasses various key metrics such as Cost Per Mille (CPM), Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Lead (CPL), Conversion Rate (CR1 and CR2), Return on Investment (ROI) and others. These metrics were calculated and visualized to provide a comprehensive understanding of campaign performance.
